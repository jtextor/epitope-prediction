# EpitopePrediction

Predicts binding of 9- to 12-mer peptides to MHC class I molecules using the [stabilized matrix method](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-394) (B. Peters and colleagues). Can predict binding for several alleles from humans (HLA A/B), mice (H-2), chimpanzees (Patr A/B), and rhesus macaques (Mamu A/B).
