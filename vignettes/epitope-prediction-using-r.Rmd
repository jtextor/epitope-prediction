## Epitope Prediction Using R

The package `EpitopePrediction` implements the stabilized matrix method (SMM), 
developed by Kim, Peters and 
colleagues [@kim09], to predict the binding strength between peptides and major 
histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I molecules. This is an essential step in vaccine design and is also
used for many other purposes in computational immunology.

SMM is a simple and fast method for peptide-MHC binding, but is slightly less accurate
than other methods like NetMHCpan. Future versions of this package may implement more
binding prediction methods.

## Getting started

As usual, load the package first.

```{r}
library(EpitopePrediction)
```

To predict which 9-mers from the CORE protein of the hepatitis C virus would bind to the
HLA-A-02:01 molecule, we can use:

```{r}
## This is the CORE protein from the Hepatitis C virus reference sequence available
## at https://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/LOCATE/locate.html
hcv.core <- paste("MSTNPKPQRKTKRNTNRRPQDVKFPGGGQIVGGVYLLPRRGPRLGVRATRKTSERSQPRGRR",
	"QPIPKARRPEGRTWAQPGYPWPLYGNEGCGWAGWLLSPRGSRPSWGPTDPRRRSRNLGKVIDTLTCGFADLMGYIP",
	"LVGAPLGGAARALAHGVRVLEDGVNYATGNLPGCSFSIFLLALLSCLTVPASA",sep="")
binders( hcv.core, "HLA-A-02:01", 9 )
```

The number of results shown can be controlled by using the 
`ic50.threshold` or `quantile.threshold` parameters.

```{r}
## All peptides with a predicted IC50 of <100
binders( hcv.core, "HLA-A-02:01", 9, ic50.threshold=100 )
```

```{r}
## The top 2% binders from the protein
binders( hcv.core, "HLA-A-02:01", 9, quantile.threshold=0.02 )
```

The `binders` function works by calling a lower-level function `smm` for all peptides
in the given protein. Of course you can also call that function directly to predict 
binding for specific peptides.

```{r}
## Predict IC50 binding values for two famous peptides
smm( c("SLYNTVATL","SYFPEITHI"), "HLA-A-02:01" )
```

The nomenclature around MHC molecules is not rigorously standardized, and various formats
are in use to name MHC molecules at 4-digit resolution. The package tries to be as 
permissive as possible in allowing different notations, for example 
`"HLA-A0201"`, `"HLA-A-0201"`, `"HLA-A*0201"`, and `"HLA-A*02:01` will all work.

## Supported MHC molecules and peptide lengths

Currently, the package supports several MHC molecules from four different species -- 
humans, mice, rhesus macaques, and chimpanzees. 
To show a list of currently supported MHC molecules and peptide
lengths, use the following R command:

```{r}
mhcs <- supportedMHCs()
levels( mhcs$mhc )
```

For all of these MHC molecules, binding strengths can be predicted at least for peptides of
length 9. For some of the more frequent molecules, also other peptide lengths are 
supported:

```{r}
mhc.table <- table( mhcs$mhc )
mhc.table[mhc.table > 1]
```

For example, these are the peptide lengths currently supported for HLA-A-02:01.

```{r}
mhcs$l[mhcs$mhc=='HLA-A-02:01']
```

This reflects a general picture: Most often, the anchor positions are the C-terminus and
the second position or a position next to it.

```{r}
hist( sapply( supportedMHCs(9)$mhc, anchorPositions ), breaks=seq(0.5,9.5,1), 
	main="Anchor positions for 9-mers", xlab="Position" )
```

## Accessing the SMM matrices

A great advantage of the SMM method above other method is that the prediction is easy to
understand -- it is based on simple scoring matrices, one matrix per combination of MHC
and peptide length. These matrices can be directly accessed.

```{r}
## load prediction matrix for HLA-A-02:01 9-mers
M <- smmMatrix( "HLA-A-02:01", 9 )$M
```

We can interrogate the matrices to learn about the binding preferences of MHC molecules.
Keep in mind that a low IC50 value means good binding, hence negative numbers indicate
binding preferences and positive numbers indicate incompatible amino acids.

```{r}
## How well is Valine liked by HLA-A02:01 at each position?
M["V",]
```

```{r}
## Which amino acid is most preferred at the C-terminal position?
names( which.min( M[,9] ) )
```

The package provides an auxiliary function to estimate the structural anchor positions of
the MHC molecules, which are the positions that "grab" the peptides, from the variance
in matrix columns.

```{r}
## Which are the anchor positions for HLA-B-27:05?
anchorPositions( "HLA-B-27:05" )
```



```{r}


```

## Generating binding motifs

A common way to visualize the binding preferences of an MHC molecule is a so-called
_binding motif_ [@lund05]. The package provides a function to generate such binding 
motifs from the
SMM matrices. In a binding motif, each column has the height of the information content
at that position, which is log(20)-H where H is the entropy at that position. Each column
is subdivided into blocks that stand for the amino acids, and each amino acid has a height
proportional to its contribution to a low IC50 value at that position.


```{r}
## Compare binding motifs of HLA-A02 at all supported peptide lengths
par( mfrow=c(2,2) )
for( l in 8:11 ){
   plotBindingMotif( "HLA-A-02:01", l )
}
```
